# 🔍 Repository Not Found - Solution

## The Issue

The repository `gryffindowr/Three60onward` returns a **404 Not Found** error because:

✅ **CONFIRMED**: You have **0 public repositories**  
✅ **CONCLUSION**: `Three60onward` is either **PRIVATE** or **doesn't exist**

## ✅ SOLUTION: Use the Dashboard

### Why Dashboard Works Better

The **Dashboard** uses GitHub OAuth, which gives access to:
- ✅ All your public repositories
- ✅ All your private repositories
- ✅ Higher API rate limits
- ✅ Better user experience

### How to Use Dashboard

1. **Click "Login for Dashboard"** (green button, top right)
   
2. **Go to "Repositories" Tab**
   - You'll see ALL your repositories
   - Both public and private
   - With stars, forks, and language info

3. **Click "Analyze"** on any repository
   - Works for private repos!
   - No token needed
   - Automatic authentication

4. **View Results**
   - Real-time stats update
   - Analytics charts
   - Complete analysis history

## Alternative: Test with Public Repository

If you want to test the classic view first, try a public repository:

### Popular Public Repositories

```
facebook/react
microsoft/vscode
nodejs/node
torvalds/linux
django/django
rails/rails
```

Just paste any of these in the classic view and click "Analyze Repository"

## Why Classic View Doesn't Work for Private Repos

The classic view requires you to manually enter a GitHub token, which is:
- ❌ Less secure
- ❌ More complicated
- ❌ Expires frequently
- ❌ Requires manual updates

The dashboard handles all of this automatically! ✨

## Check Your Repositories

### Option 1: Via Dashboard
1. Login to dashboard
2. Go to "Repositories" tab
3. See all your repos

### Option 2: Via GitHub
1. Go to: https://github.com/gryffindowr?tab=repositories
2. Check if `Three60onward` exists
3. Check if it's public or private

## Make Repository Public (Optional)

If you want to analyze from classic view:

1. Go to repository settings:
   https://github.com/gryffindowr/Three60onward/settings

2. Scroll to "Danger Zone"

3. Click "Change visibility" → "Make public"

**⚠️ WARNING**: Only do this if:
- No sensitive data in code
- No API keys or passwords
- No proprietary code
- You want it publicly accessible

## Summary

| Method | Public Repos | Private Repos | Ease of Use |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Easy |
| **Classic View** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No* | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium |

*Classic view needs manual token for private repos

## Recommended Action

**👉 Use the Dashboard!**

1. Click "Login for Dashboard"
2. Go to "Repositories"
3. Find your repository
4. Click "Analyze"
5. Done! ✨

No token needed, no configuration, just works!

**Quick Answer**: Your repository is private. Use the dashboard instead of classic view! 🚀
